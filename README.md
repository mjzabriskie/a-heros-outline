## Usage

To use A Hero's Outline, a user should first sign up for an account. Logging in will allow the user to view a dashboard page where they can access and edit their saved outlines in addition to creating new ones. From the dashboard, each saved outline will be presented with options to either delete or view (edit). When creating or editing an outline, the user can view the whole outline together, or an outline wizard can be used to address each step of the outline in sequence. When done working with an outline, pressing the "Save Outline" button will save the outline to the database and return the user to the dashboard. For purposes of security, the page has been guarded against access without properly logging in, and only the user's own outlines can be viewed.
